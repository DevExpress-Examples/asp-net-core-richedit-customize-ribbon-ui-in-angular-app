# RichEdit for Angular - How to customize the built-in ribbon

This example is a ready-to-use client Angular application with the DevExpress RichEdit component. The example demonstrates how to modify the built-in ribbon in the RichEdit control. 
The **ribbon** option allows you to access RichEdit's built-in ribbon. You can get the required tabs and items using the **getTab** and the **getItem** methods respectively. 
Then, you can add necessary items or remove unnecessary ones using the **insertItem** and **removeItem** methods.
