# RichEdit for Angular - How to customize the built-in ribbon

This example is a ready-to-use client Angular application with the DevExpress RichEdit component. It demonstrates how to modify the built-in ribbon in the RichEdit control. 
The **ribbon** option allows you to access RichEdit's built-in ribbon. You can get required tabs and items using the **getTab** and **getItem** methods respectively. 
Then, you can add or remove items using the **insertItem** and **removeItem** methods.

## Requirements
* To use the RichEdit control in an Angular application, you need to have a [Universal, DXperience, or ASP.NET subscription](https://www.devexpress.com/buy/net/).
* Versions of the devexpress npm packages should be identical (their major and minor versions should be the same).

## Quick Start

1. Open the **JS** folder. In the command prompt, download and install npm packages that are used in the application:

```
npm install
```

2. In the same folder, run the following command to compile and run the application:

```
