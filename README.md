# Rich Text Editor for ASP.NET Core - How to customize the built-in Ribbon UI in an Angular application

This example is a ready-to-use Angular client application that demonstrates how to customize the DevExpress [Rich Text Editor](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/400373/office-inspired-controls/controls/rich-edit)'s Ribbon UI.

![Customize Ribbon](customize-richedit-ribbon.png)

The Ribbon is a tabbed toolbar that groups command items on different tabs according to their purpose. Use the Rich Text Editor's [ribbon](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/js-DevExpress.RichEdit.Options#js_devexpress_richedit_options_ribbon) option to access and customize the built-in Ribbon UI. The [getTab](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/js-DevExpress.RichEdit.Ribbon#js_devexpress_richedit_ribbon_gettab_id_) and [getItem](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/js-DevExpress.RichEdit.RibbonTab#js_devexpress_richedit_ribbontab_getitem_id_) methods allow you to access Ribbon tabs and their items. Call the [insertTab](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/js-DevExpress.RichEdit.Ribbon#js_devexpress_richedit_ribbon_inserttab_tab_) and [removeTab](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/js-DevExpress.RichEdit.Ribbon#js_devexpress_richedit_ribbon_removetab_tab_) methods to modify the collection of tabs. To modify the item collection in a tab, call its [insertItem](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/js-DevExpress.RichEdit.RibbonTab#js_devexpress_richedit_ribbontab_insertitem_item_) and [removeItem](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/js-DevExpress.RichEdit.RibbonTab#js_devexpress_richedit_ribbontab_removeitem_item_) methods.
